# ADVENT

This is a small Kotlin program that I'm using to gain familiarity with Kotlin and IDEA. It implements a simple Zork- or Adventure-like text game, define by a DSL that is part of the project. 

The program is created in very small steps, guided by tests in most all cases. The [article series "kotlin"](https://ronjeffries.com/categories/kotlin/) chronicles the development of this effort. Issues welcome, though email or Twitter will reach me more reliably. No pull requests, please.
